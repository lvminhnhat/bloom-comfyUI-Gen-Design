Credits Management

# Credits Management

In this article, we will introduce ComfyUI’s credit management features, including how to obtain, use, and view credits.

The credit system was added to support the `API Nodes`, as calling closed-source AI models requires token consumption, so proper credit management is necessary. By default, the credits interface is not displayed. Please first log in to your ComfyUI account in `Settings` -&gt; `User`, and then you can view your associated account’s credit information in `Settings` -&gt; `Credits`.

ComfyUI will always remain fully open-source and free for local users.

## [​](http://docs.comfy.org#frequently-asked-questions) Frequently Asked Questions

Can credits go negative?

No, when your credit balance is negative, you will not be able to run API Nodes

Can I get a refund for unused credits?

Currently, we do not support refunds

How do I check my current balance and usage?

Click on `Settings` -&gt; `Credits` to see your current balance and access the `Credit History` entry

Can I share my credits with other users?

You can log into the same account on multiple devices, but we do not support sharing credits with other users

How do I know how many credits I've consumed each time?

Due to different image sizes and generation quantities, the `Tokens` and `Credits` consumed each time vary. In `Settings` -&gt; `Credits`, you can see the credits consumed each time and the corresponding credit history
